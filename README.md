This Repository serves as my portfolio in documenting my progress in learning Power BI.

I will be uploading my Power BI files from when I started learning the Basics, the tutorials I am learning, up until I have my first personal project using Power BI.

**Branches**
1. Learning the Basics
   - Where fundamentals of using Power BI are used
     
2. Tutorials
   - Where basic transformations are being applied to one or more sources in Power BI
