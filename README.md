This Repository serves as my portfolio in documenting my progress in learning Power BI.

I will be uploading my Power BI files from when I started learning the Basics, the tutorials I am learning, up until I have my first personal project using Power BI.

**Tutorials**
   - Where basic transformations are being applied to one or more sources in Power BI

**1. Shaping and Combining Data Samples**
Shaping and Combining two data sources (web data source)

**2. Importing and Analyzing Web Page**
Analyzing the UEFA European Championship (Euro Cup) winners over the years.

Used the Pie Chart to also show the Winner count for Soviet Union since the Map Chart doesn't show it since it doesn't exists in the world map anymore.

Created Chart Visualizations:
a. Stacked Column Chart
